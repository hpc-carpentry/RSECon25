\begin{frame}{Overview}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item What is The Carpentries
		\item A Very Brief History of The Carpentries
		\item Where does HPC Carpentry fit?
		\item Current Status
		\item Roadmap
		\item The mini version
		\item Comms Channels
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\note{What we will look at is what The Carpentries is about and how it came into existence. Most of you are probably quite familiar with it anyway so it will be very short. We'll then look at what HPC Carpentry is and how that came about. What the current status of the HPC Carpentries is and what our future plans are. I wouldn't be myself if I didn't squeeze a bit of the miniHPC in here, so I'll quickly mention that and then I'll leave you with ways to get into contact us so that you too can join us in brining HPC Carpentries to researchers.}
